title: "Query Parquet open data on S3 from your own machine with Apache Impala and DuckDB"

You don't need SaaS data warehouses or query engines like Snowflake or AWS Athena to
access the trove of open data available for free on S3 and S3-compatible cloud stores.
A fast, optimizing, SQL engine is enough to run analytics locally.

Here is how two popular engines - [Apache Impala](https://impala.apache.org/) and 
duckdb(https://duckdb.org/) - can find the largest parks in the worlds in this 
dataset with OpenStreetMap locations - <https://daylightmap.org/earth/> .

## Get started with DuckDB

DuckDB gets you started faster. [Install](<https://duckdb.org/#quickinstall>) it first,
then start the CLI with `duckdb` :

Then read data with [read_parquet](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/parquet/overview#read_parquet-function), associate with a view and explore the results:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW earth AS
SELECT * FROM 
read_parquet('s3://daylight-openstreetmap/earth/release=v1.58/*/*', hive_partitioning = true);

DESCRIBE earth;
```

The `daylight-openstreetmap` S3 bucket is open so there is no need to configure [S3 authentication](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/httpfs/s3api.html).

You'll see something like this:
